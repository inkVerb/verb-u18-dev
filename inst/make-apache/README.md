# Make Apache Verber subs
This is a dev module, a sub program to make basic subdomains for a Verber.

This is not normally used, but can be handy to create many basic subdomain apache config files.

It is largely redundant, but incomplete compared to, the newverbsub serf and requires setubverb to already have run.

Theoretically, it could be used in future versions to reduce the initial apache configs in the verb installer repo.
