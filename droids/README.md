# Verber Droids
These are your own plugins that you can create, like your own custom "serfs".

## Instructions
Start the file with this:

`#!/bin/bash`

`#inkVerberDroid! verb.ink`

`# This says what the droid does`

`## This has any more comments or instructions`

` `

`# How to use:`

`## mydroid [ any options ]`

` `

`# Eg:`

`## mydroid`

`## mydroid my-options`


...then skip two lines and add whatever you want.
